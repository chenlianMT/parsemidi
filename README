parsemidi is a simple MIDI file parser that prints note events to stdout.

usage: java ParseMidi [-t bpm] [-n track] file

The -t option overrides the internal tempo with the given bpm. If a track
number is given with the -n option, the parser will only output events from
this particular track.

The output is one line per note in the following format:

[onset time] [offset time] [track no] [note] [velocity]

Limitations:
- No support for SMTP time offsets
- No support for tempo changes across tracks
